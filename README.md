### Algorithms Design and Analysis - Merge Sort

---

#### **Project Overview**
This project explores the design and analysis of the **Merge Sort algorithm**, a fundamental sorting algorithm in computer science based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm. The project includes a detailed presentation, technical documentation, and Python pseudocode to illustrate the algorithm's functionality, efficiency, and use cases.

#### **Merge Sort Algorithm**
1. **Steps:**
   - If the list contains only one element, it is already sorted.
   - Divide the list into two halves until no further division is possible.
   - Recursively merge the sub-lists into a sorted list.

2. **Advantages:**
   - Efficient for large datasets.
   - Offers consistent performance with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).

3. **Disadvantages:**
   - Requires extra space for subarrays.
   - May be slower for small arrays.

4. **Applications:**
   - Sorting large datasets.
   - Used in scenarios requiring stable sorting.
